            What is Javascript???
          </h2>
           <p>
              The primary use of JavaScript is to build web-based applications. Some of what JavaScript 
              can do for the web includes: adding interactive behavior to web pages like zooming in and
              out or playing audio/video. creating web and mobile apps, the most popular examples consist 
             of the likes of Netflix and Uber.
              </p>
              <p>
            JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one 
            of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
            As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
            behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers
            have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms
            to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-
            orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-
            driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
            interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data 
            structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
          </p>
            
          <p>
            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core 
            components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime
            system for this usage is Node.js.

          <h2> Difference bewtween JavaScript and Java???</h2>
          <p>
            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard
            libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.Java is an 
            OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language. Java creates 
            applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a
            browser only. Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.
