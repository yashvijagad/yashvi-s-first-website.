  <h2>What is a Website???</h2>
  <p>
    A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages
    and related content that is identified by a common domain name and
    published on at least one web server. Examples of notable websites
    are Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Wikipedia.
  </p>

  <p>
    All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.
    There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network,
    such as a company's internal website for its employees.
  </p>

  <p>
    Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news,
    education, commerce, entertainment, or social networking. Hyperlinking between 
    web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.

    How i created a website???
  </h3>
  <p>
   So before i tell you about how i created a website I'd like to give a lilttle introduction on myself.
   Hello! Everyone I am Yashvi Jagad from Amarjyoti international school and i'm in grade 9th science.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well creating a website wasn't an easy task for me as web development was totally a new
    concept for me at the begining it was quiet difficult for me to undersatnd but then later 
    on as i started to figure out what it is and how it is with the help of my mentor, 
    it started to get easier for me and i started understanding how it actually works and how 
    many efforts it requires to create a website.
  </p>
  <p>
   So how i learnt to create a simple website was to start with HTML, in HTML i discovered about new features
   and how i can use them in designing my website and I will also be presenting the basic features of HTML
   further in the website. Then i began with JavaScript on Codecademy and took few classes about it.And then
   I created a sample website but that would be visible to me only as it was saved on my local drive so then I 
   learnt about how my website can be visible to everyone by using Github, it allowed me to upload my file on 
   so that when i give some one the link to my website it will be visible to everyone.nd that's how i learnt to 
   create a simple website.
